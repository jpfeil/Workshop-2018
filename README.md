# BD2K Summer Coding Workshop

Welcome! The goal of this workshop is to get your Python environment up to speed. We will discuss useful coding tools, environments, and structuring a project. There isn't one way or even a common standard. One of the great things about open source software is you can take this information and modify it to suite your needs.
